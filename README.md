# 👋 Hi, I'm Mauro

🚗 **Senior Diagnostics Strategist** | 🧠 **Systems Engineer** | 🛠️ **API Architect**  
**Official Open Source Contributor** at CARIAD | Driving **SOVD** adoption through open collaboration

Welcome to my technical portfolio. With over 25 years in automotive diagnostics and systems engineering, I specialize in bridging the gap between **standardization**, **architecture**, and **implementation**—especially in the context of **Service-Oriented Vehicle Diagnostics (SOVD)**, **UDS**, **DoIP**, and **ODX/OTX**.

---

## 🔧 Core Competencies

- **Diagnostics Standards**: ISO SOVD, UDS, DoIP, ODX, OTX, ePTI
- **API Design & Integration**: RESTful APIs, OpenAPI, YAML/JSON transformation
- **Backend Development**: Python, Golang, FastAPI, gRPC
- **Tooling**: VSCode, Docker, GitLab CI/CD, Vector Informatik toolchain
- **Edge Computing**: Containerization, diagnostics over IP, secure remote access

## 🚀 Highlight Project: SOVD Proof of Concept (PoC)

✅ Led the successful implementation of a multi-client, multi-server **SOVD PoC** at CARIAD:
✅ Configured multi‑client diagnostics workflows using SOVD principles
✅ Integrated anonymized capability descriptions via a /docs endpoint (YAML/JSON)
✅ Built a mock API gateway demonstrating how partner APIs can map to a single SOVD shape
✅ Delivered a gap analysis between custom partner APIs and ISO/DIS 17978‑3 SOVD API
✅ Presented a strategic roadmap for group‑wide diagnostics harmonization
🔜 Creating SOVD-Lab as my contribution in alignment with the Eclipse OpenSOVD (Apache 2.0) project

## 📚 Continuous Learning Journey (CARIAD‑supported)
✅ VS Code setup & GitHub integration
✅ License normalization (Apache‑2.0 for code, CC BY 4.0 for docs, CC0 for data)
✅ Docker fundamentals (Dev Containers, Dockerfiles, Compose, Play with Docker sandbox)
✅ Redocly command line vs OpenAPI 3.1.0 vs ASAM/ISO SOVD specification
🔜 OpenSOVD odx-converter and classic-diagnostic-adapter prerequisites, learnings, and setup (Kotlin, Gradle, RUST) — in progress
🔜 Python & Go containers for diagnostics backends — in progress
🔜 Deployment strategies for edge and backend services
🔜 CI/CD pipelines for diagnostics microservices

## Learning and sharing in Public (2025)

I publish a **Wednesday tech demo** + **Saturday explainer**:
- **Repo:** SOVD‑Lab — runnable demos (Docker, REST `.http`, CLI, tiny web clients and servers with multiple languages)
- **Articles:** Diagnostics Demystified — short public versions

**Next up**
- VSCode helped with OpenSOVD - tech by doing *(Wed)*
- 005 — Inside OBD‑II *(Sat)*
- OBD-II quirks & pitfalls - tech by doing *(Wed)*  
- 006 — Understanding ISO 14229 (UDS) *(Sat)*
- Safety relevant diagnostics - tech by doing *(Wed)*
- Conferences resume - focus on SOVD status *( > 25 October)*
- 007 - How to diagnose a braking system without losing sight of SOTIF

📊 KPIs (Publicly Tracked)
Multi‑client coverage: REST + CLI + web client ✔
Reusability: 0 custom SOVD server/client beyond Eclipse OpenSOVD ✔
Harmonization demos: anonymized partner APIs → SOVD mappings ✔
IP hygiene: 100% SPDX headers; 0 license check failures in CI
Community: Time‑to‑first‑response < 48h; ≥5 “good first issues” open

🔐 IP Safety
I strive to follow strict IP rules: no confidential data, no ASAM/ISO spec text, synthetic datasets only.
➡ Details in docs/10-ip-safety.md.
