# 👋 Hi, I'm Mauro Cerrato

🚗 **Senior Diagnostics Strategist** | 🧠 **Systems Engineer** | 🛠️ **API Architect**

Welcome to my technical portfolio. With over 25 years in automotive diagnostics and systems engineering, I specialize in bridging the gap between **standardization**, **architecture**, and **implementation**—especially in the context of **Service-Oriented Vehicle Diagnostics (SOVD)**, **UDS**, **DoIP**, and **ODX/OTX**.

---

## 🔧 Core Competencies

- **Diagnostics Standards**: ISO SOVD, UDS, DoIP, ODX, OTX, ePTI
- **API Design & Integration**: RESTful APIs, OpenAPI, YAML/JSON transformation
- **Backend Development**: Python, Golang, FastAPI, gRPC
- **Tooling**: VSCode, Docker, GitLab CI/CD, Vector Informatik toolchain
- **Edge Computing**: Containerization, diagnostics over IP, secure remote access

---

## 🚀 Highlight Project: SOVD Proof of Concept (PoC)

Led the successful implementation of a multi-client, multi-server **SOVD PoC** at CARIAD:

- ✅ Configured SOVD servers across Munich, Berlin, and Wolfsburg locations
- ✅ Integrated CARIAD PDX data into Vector’s SOVD server
- ✅ Enabled RESTful diagnostics workflows via VSCode and browser enabled diagnostic clients
- ✅ Developed a mock API gateway bridging **RiDE API** and **ISO SOVD API**
- ✅ Delivered a formal **gap analysis** between Rivian’s RiDE API and ISO/DIS 17978-3 SOVD API
- ✅ Mastered **Capability Description** via SOVD standard `/docs` endpoint using YAML/JSON
- ✅ Presented strategic roadmap for SOVD adoption across VW Group brands
